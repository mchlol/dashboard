# Personal Dashboard

![image](./dashboard-screenshot.png)

Part of the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)

A simple little vanilla JS project for working with promise rejection.  
The idea is that this would be a Chrome extension similar to the [Momentum dashboard](https://momentumdash.com/).  
On this occasion I did not follow the lesson exactly ðŸ˜… but took the concept and built my own version of it.

My changes:

- The background image is new for each refresh, so I added the functionality to freeze it (save it) if you like it
- I added the functionality to save the image query to storage and also to change the image query.
- used CSS grid (instead of flexbox) for the styling including putting a vignette between the content and background image using radial-gradient.
- The weather API stuff IS part of the lesson but I built my version beforehand on my own, and using a different API.
- I don't care particularly for crypto so I put recipes in that section instead.
